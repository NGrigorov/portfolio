											<h2>Hi, I'm an aspiring software engineer</h2>
											<p>Well-Experienced in unity3d development - vr&AR, 3d&2d development, webgl and networking</p>
										</header>
										<p>My passion is in the entertainment industry. I love making web-apps, interactive midea and/or games. Whether for other people to enjoy or as an excuse to learn new technology.
                                        
                                        <br>
                                            <br>    I am about to be a Bachelor’s degree graduate in Software engineering and I am looking for opportunities to work all over the world. I want to get out of my comfort zone and learn and get experience from people all over the world rather than sticking to the country I graduated from.
											<br><br>During my education I’ve worked at 2 companies as an intern and the second internship was a graduation thesis for my degree. During this period, I’ve learned a lot about the whole process of software development: gathering requirements from the client/employer, researching the best possible path and managing my own work via development methodologies & project management, both in helping and managing pre-existing products and creating proof of concepts on my own for the employer.

												<h3>Coding</h3>
												<p>During my software development career, I've had to learn a lot of languages. Some of them I've only used once or twice and some of them I'm using very frequently. Because of this I feel comfortable saying that I am a very fast learner of new programming languages. I have the most experience with C#</p>
